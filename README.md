# GamerifyBot
an Discord Bot made for a dead-ass discord server. (note: this bot was made for fun, and is not meant to be used in bigger servers. This bot is very messy and bad, and is on the development stage.)

This bot was made with fun in mind, the bot doesnt work anymore, etc.

# Info
This bot is made in DiscordJS and for fun. I was bored, and decided to make a bot, so this isnt probably that bad. Only issue, it doesnt work.

# How to setup
Simply, go to the Discord developer portal and make a new application. Take a bot-token and use it in the code to control the bot.
If you have no idea how to do this, watch a youtube video.
